This study group focuses on the K&R C Programming book.

I am a novice programmer. So all of the things found in here are from following that book and discussion on Discord.
This is my second repository after the first hello-world from github help. If things are not done correctly, I am always open
to polite constructive criticism.

I am working on formatting. Things will look very ugly for awhile. I use Notepad++ so formatting looks fine there, but doesn't
transfer very well.
